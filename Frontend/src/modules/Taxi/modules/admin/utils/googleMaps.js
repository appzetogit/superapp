/**
 * Google Maps for the taxi panels.
 *
 * The key comes from the same place the food admin panel gets it: the runtime
 * config at /api/v1/env/public, which serves what an admin saved under
 * Integration settings -> Map. Both panels write the one `map_apis` block on the
 * server, so there is a single key and a single reader.
 *
 * Why the key is read per render rather than once at import:
 *
 * This module is reachable from the entry chunk, and ES modules evaluate before
 * any of the entry file's own statements run. Reading the key at module scope
 * therefore happened before index.jsx could resolve the runtime config, so the
 * panel captured the empty build-time value and froze it. useJsApiLoader makes
 * that permanent -- it calls load() from an effect with an empty dependency
 * list, so it runs once with whatever key existed at the first render of the
 * first map component and never retries. Loading with an empty key is what
 * produced the watermarked "For development purposes only" map and Google's
 * "This page can't load Google Maps correctly" dialog.
 *
 * refresh() re-reads on every hook call and updates the exported bindings.
 * Those are `let`, so the ~20 components importing HAS_VALID_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY see
 * the corrected value through the module's live binding: the hook runs at the
 * top of a component, before its JSX is evaluated. A component that reads the
 * flag without calling the hook would still see the import-time value, but every
 * map screen calls the hook to render at all.
